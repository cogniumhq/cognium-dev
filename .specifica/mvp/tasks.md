## Open — High Priority

- [ ] **Residual Python FPs on OWASP BenchmarkPython** (follow-up to Issue #4, post-3.23.5)
  - Current on 3.23.5: TPR 81.2%, **FPR 12.6%**, F1 80.0%, 91 FPs / 1230 tests (target FPR ≤ 2%)
  - Breakdown: codeinj (18), xpathi (17), pathtraver (14), redirect (12), xxe (10), xss (9), ldapi (7), trustbound (2), cmdi (2), deserialization (7 residual after `yaml.safe_load` carve-out)
  - Hypothesis: same safe-variant-over-matching pattern as `yaml.safe_load` repeats in other Python plugin sink methods (`PythonPlugin.getBuiltinSinks()`); audit each category's sink list against the safe-API surface
  - Must precede any 3.24.0 framework expansion to avoid stacking confounds
  - Cross-ref: `cogniumhq/circle-ir-ai#75`

- [ ] **Consolidate Python sink source-of-truth** (architectural, surfaced by Issue #4 fix)
  - Current state: Python sinks live in THREE places — `configs/sinks/python.json`, `config-loader.ts::DEFAULT_SINKS`, and `PythonPlugin.getBuiltinSinks()` in `src/languages/plugins/python.ts`. Only the last is consulted at runtime for the language path
  - ADR-004 + `principles.md` currently claim `config-loader.ts` is THE runtime source-of-truth — this is incomplete for language-plugin-driven sinks (it's a 3-way split, not 2-way)
  - Action: either (a) collapse plugin `getBuiltinSinks()` into `DEFAULT_SINKS`, or (b) update ADR-004 + principles to honestly describe the 3-way model and pick a canonical one per language
  - Triggered by 7834e19 — fix landed in plugin, not config-loader

- [ ] **GitHub Action `cognium-dev/scan@v1` marketplace listing**
  - Owner: —
  - Status: `packages/cli/action.yml` rebranded to `cognium-dev` (npm name, CLI binary, SARIF category) in d0957b6 — usable today as `cogniumhq/cognium-dev/packages/cli@cognium-dev-vX.Y.Z`
  - Remaining: extract to standalone `cognium-dev/scan` repo, tag `v1`, publish marketplace listing

- [ ] **Java benchmarks** — Publish comparison vs Snyk/Checkmarx/Semgrep
  - Owner: —
  - Due: Phase 1 (May 2026)

## Open — Medium Priority

- [ ] **Cross-instance field-binding propagation** (Jenkins / general engine gap, Issue #1)
  - `this.field = param` in one method → `other.field` read in another method on an aliased instance
  - Required to close the remaining CWE-Bench-Java Jenkins `ReadTrustedStep.run()` path end-to-end (CVE-2022-25175)
  - Engine-level (DFG cross-instance reasoning), not a YAML/config change
  - Audited 2026-06-10: ~420 LOC across `dfg.ts` + `taint-propagation.ts` + `cross-file.ts` + new `field-binding-resolver.ts`. Honest difficulty 7/10. Moderate-to-high regression risk on OWASP 100/100/97.7% TPR benchmarks
  - **Deferred to cognium-ai triage** — if LLM-discovery already covers this CVE, close circle-ir-side as won't-fix; if not, prioritize with explicit benchmark-gate plan. Issue #1 left open pending their call

- [ ] **TSX / JSX parsing** (follow-up to 3.24.0)
  - 3.24.0 ships pure-TS only via `tree-sitter-typescript.wasm`. `.tsx` files still hit the JS grammar path (the broken pre-3.24.0 behavior for inline-object-type params) — and JSX additionally produces ERROR nodes the JS grammar cannot recover from
  - Action: bundle `tree-sitter-tsx.wasm` (also shipped by `tree-sitter-typescript@0.23.2`, ~1.45 MB), dispatch `.tsx` to it from the language plugin, mirror the `required_parameter` / `optional_parameter` work for any TSX-only param node shapes
  - Test coverage: add `tests/extractors/types-tsx.test.ts` with JSX-element-returning components

- [ ] **Interface extraction enrichment** (follow-up to 3.24.0)
  - The TS grammar now produces `interface_declaration` nodes, but `extractJavaScriptTypes` only walks `class_declaration` / `function_declaration` / named arrow funcs. Interfaces currently fall on the floor
  - Action: extend `extractJavaScriptTypes` (`src/core/extractors/types.ts`) to emit `interface_declaration` as `TypeInfo` with `kind: 'interface'`, populating `fields` from `property_signature` and `methods` from `method_signature`
  - Needed for cross-instance taint analysis when the type contract is declared as an interface

- [ ] **Generic / union / intersection type surfacing** (follow-up to 3.24.0)
  - `generic_type`, `union_type`, `intersection_type` nodes are now present in the TS-grammar tree but not converted into IR fields. `ParameterInfo.type` currently stores the raw source slice; structured representation would let passes reason about `Array<T>` vs `T[]`, nullable unions, etc.
  - Lower priority than the two above; defer until a pass actually needs structured TS type info

- [ ] **Framework coverage expansion** (proposed 3.25.0+)
  - JS/TS: Next.js API routes, TypeORM sinks, narrow `.value` dom_input source
  - Python: Jinja2 XSS sinks; additional MyBatis/Django ORM raw query patterns
  - Java: Micronaut, Quarkus
  - Rust: Axum extractor refinement, SQLx, Reqwest
  - All YAML-only except dom_input narrowing

- [ ] **Dependency analysis** — CVE matching, SBOM generation
  - Maps to: cognium-ai MCP `analyze_dependencies`
  - Formats: CycloneDX, SPDX

- [ ] **Supply chain risk** — Slopsquatting detection, package trust
  - Maps to: cognium-ai MCP `find_supply_chain_risk`

## Open — Low Priority

- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** — GitHub Actions for monorepo builds
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks** — Lint, typecheck, test on commit

## Completed

- [x] **Release 3.177.0** — Bundled `#254` perf partials (T1#5 `receiverMightBeClass` memo, T2#7 language-filter hoist, T2#10 `walkBackwardDefs` memo, T1#2 constant-prop tree-walk fusion, T2#9 `buildCFG` Bash+Go nodeCache reuse), `#257` Java `code_injection` `*Parser` semantic gate (closes Elide FP), and `#240` ship 2 zero-recall coverage (`deserialization` + `nosql_injection` framework sinks + Go local-receiver type resolver). IR semantic change: Go `CallInfo.receiver` now holds resolved type name for local-variable operands (documented in CLI changelog). 4087 pass, 3 skipped, 0 regressions vs 3.176.0. (86852ec, 2026-07-23)
- [x] **Release 3.34.0** — Runtime-registration extractor Phase 3 (Rust trait dispatch, #15). New `RuntimeRegistration.kind = 'trait_impl'` covers (a) `impl Trait for Type` blocks emitting one registration per method with stdlib / actix / axum / rocket / tokio / serde / unknown classification via last-segment + prefix matching, (b) `inventory::submit! { Plugin::new(...) }` macros as `framework: 'inventory'` with handler from token tree, (c) `#[linkme::distributed_slice]` / `#[distributed_slice]` attributes as `framework: 'linkme'` walking parent siblings to next `static_item` / `function_item`. Rust node cache extended with `attribute_item` + `static_item`. 11 new tests; suite 1895 passing. Closes #15 (Phase 3 of 3 — full runtime-registration roadmap complete). (bbb59c1, 2026-06-10)
- [x] **Release 3.33.0** — Runtime-registration extractor Phase 2 (Python decorators, #15). Records every `@decorator` on `def`/`async def`: Flask/FastAPI routes as `http_route`, `@app.before_request`/`@app.after_request` as `middleware`, `@app.errorhandler` as `event_listener`, `@pytest.fixture`/`@click.command()`/`@property` etc. as `decorator` with framework tags (`pytest`, `click`, `stdlib`, `numba`, `celery`, `django`, `unknown`). Chained decorators emit one registration each. 10 new tests; suite 1884 passing. (a6c74ed, 2026-06-10)
- [x] **Release 3.32.0** — Runtime-registration extractor Phase 1 (JS/TS Express family, #15). New optional IR field `runtime_registrations: RuntimeRegistration[]` recording HTTP routes (`app.METHOD(path, handler)`), middleware (`app.use`, `router.use`), event listeners (`server.on`, `emitter.once`). Handler resolution: named identifier → declaration site, inline arrow → `name: null` at lambda site, member-expression → textual reference. Receiver filtering: express-shaped names or any receiver with framework module imported. 10 new tests; suite 1874 passing. (8fef35b, 2026-06-10)
- [x] **Release 3.31.0** — Java SAST sink expansion: NiFi EL injection (#11, CVE-2023-36542, `PropertyValue.evaluateAttributeExpressions` as `code_injection`/CWE-94/critical) + XWiki rendering pipeline XSS (#10, 5 CVEs — sources `XWikiRequest.getParameter*/getHeader`, sinks `WikiPrinter.print*`, `XHTMLWikiPrinter.print*`, `DefaultBlockRenderer.render`). 4 new regression tests; suite 1864 passing. Closes #10 and #11. (a9039de, 2026-06-09)
- [x] **Release 3.30.0** — Encoding-aware path traversal propagation for Shiro CWE-022 (#8). Decoder methods (`URLDecoder.decode`, `Normalizer.normalize`, etc.) now propagate taint forward rather than sanitize. Closes #8. (b4fb62a, 2026-06-09)
- [x] **Release 3.29.0** — Apache Camel mail path-traversal sink (#12, CVE-2018-8041) + Java enterprise sink-shape FP fix (#14, DBeaver / Dubbo / Ruoyi / JeecgBoot / XXL-JOB). Closes #12 and #14. (2beddea, 2026-06-09)
- [x] **Release 3.28.0** — WASM memory leak fix (#16). Every `analyze()` previously created `new Parser()` and a `Tree`, neither ever `.delete()`'d, causing tree-sitter WASM heap to grow monotonically across 120-project benchmark runs. Both now disposed; static baseline restored. Closes #16. (2026-06-09)
- [x] **Release 3.27.1** — `scan-secrets` pass #90 (CWE-798, #79 in repo bookkeeping). Two-layer hardcoded-credential detection across all 7 languages: ~16 provider-specific regex patterns (AWS AKIA, GitHub ghp_/gho_/ghs_/ghu_/ghr_, Stripe sk_live_/pk_live_, OpenAI sk-, Anthropic sk-ant-, Slack xox[baprs]-, Google AIza, JWT, PEM, npm_) emitting `hardcoded-credential` (critical/error) + Shannon-entropy scan on string literals 20–200 chars (≥4.3 bits/char base64, ≥3.5 bits/char hex) with UUID/hash/placeholder/base64-JSON denylist emitting `hardcoded-credential-entropy` (high/warning). Test-file paths skipped; dedupes against legacy Bash detection via new `PassContext.getFindings?()` accessor. 39 new tests. Versions 3.26.0 and 3.27.0 prepared locally but never published — content shipped as 3.27.1. (947282b, 2026-06-04)
- [x] **Release 3.25.0** — version-bump-only re-publish issued ~40s after 3.24.0 to ensure a clean npm publish window; no source, config, or pass-pipeline changes. CHANGELOG auto-prepend records "(no commits since last release)" for both packages. Substantive changes for this stream are entirely in 3.24.0. (4168550, 2026-06-02)
- [x] **Release 3.24.0** — TS parser fix for Issue #5: ship real `tree-sitter-typescript.wasm` (v0.23.2), remove both `typescript → javascript` grammar redirects in `core/parser.ts`, add `required_parameter` / `optional_parameter` handling in `extractJSParameters`, populate `ParameterInfo.type` for TS code. 6 new regression tests in `tests/extractors/types-typescript.test.ts`; full suite 1810 passing, 0 failing. `.tsx` / JSX, interface IR enrichment, and generic-type surfacing tracked as separate follow-ups. (20df02f, 2026-06-02)
- [x] **Release 3.23.5** — source-side fix for Issue #4: `yaml.safe_load` removed from `PythonPlugin.getBuiltinSinks()`; `yaml.unsafe_load` + `yaml.full_load` added as CWE-502 sinks. OWASP BenchmarkPython delta: deser FP 24→7, FPR 14.8%→12.6%, F1 78.6%→80.0%. Closes #4 (source-side) and #6 (direct-to-main review). Residual 91 FPs tracked separately. (7834e19 + 2cd9032, 2026-05-30)
- [x] **Release 3.23.4** — documentation-only release: `PUBLISHING.md` + `RELEASE.md` rewrites pointing to root `release.sh`, `action.yml` rebrand to `cognium-dev`, README benchmark table split by language with BenchmarkPython qualification, `.gitignore` adds `.claude/`. No engine/taint-config changes. Known issue #4 (Python FPR 14.8%) carries forward. (7b679ad, 2026-05-30)
- [x] **Pre-populated CHANGELOG entries** — committed before `release.sh` ran so the auto-prepend produced a single canonical entry per package (c6bbd71, 2026-05-30)
- [x] **Pass-count consolidation** — README + CLAUDE no longer duplicate pass/metric counts; both link to `packages/circle-ir/docs/PASSES.md` (d0957b6, 2026-05-29)
- [x] **Release docs refresh** — Rewrote `packages/cli/RELEASE.md` and `packages/circle-ir/PUBLISHING.md` as pointers to root `release.sh`; dropped stale Homebrew + per-platform binary + `v*`-trigger workflow content (d0957b6, 2026-05-29)
- [x] **GitHub Action rebrand** — `packages/cli/action.yml` renamed to "cognium-dev SAST scan"; npm package + CLI binary + SARIF category switched from `cognium` → `cognium-dev`; README CI example points to actual usable path (d0957b6, 2026-05-29)
- [x] **Release 3.23.3** — `@DataBoundConstructor` method-level annotation source matcher; new `method_annotation` field on `SourcePattern`; closes source-side of #1 (2026-05-28)
- [x] **Release 3.23.2** — Jenkins `SCMFileSystem.child(String)` path-traversal sink (CVE-2022-25175 sink side) (2026-05-28)
- [x] **Release 3.23.1** — closed #3 (sink misclassifications); 20 wrong-type sink entries removed (2026-05-28)
- [x] **Release 3.23.0** — initial monorepo npm publish stream (2026-05-28)
- [x] **Monorepo hygiene** — root `release.sh`, dropped stale per-package lockfiles (2026-05-28)
- [x] **Monorepo structure** — Set up workspace with preserved git history (2026-05-26)
- [x] **CLI rebrand** — Rename cognium → cognium-dev (2026-05-26)
- [x] **Shared tsconfig** — Create base TypeScript config (2026-05-26)
- [x] **CLAUDE.md** — Combined guidance document (2026-05-26)
- [x] **GitHub repo setup** — Push to cogniumhq/cognium-dev (2026-05-26)
- [x] **Archive old repos** — circle-ir → archived, cognium → cognium-sast-cli archived (2026-05-26)
- [x] **Documentation review** — Update all README/docs for monorepo (2026-05-26)
- [x] **MyBatis ORM sinks** — Add 12 MyBatis mapper SQL injection sinks (2026-05-26)
- [x] **Issue migration** — Transfer CWE-Bench issue from archived repo (2026-05-26)

### #1 detail (kept from prior version)

**#1** (re-opened 2026-06-10) — Jenkins `@DataBoundConstructor` cross-instance field-binding taint. Sink (3.23.2) + source detection (3.23.3) both shipped; remaining is cross-instance DFG flow analysis (~420 LOC, 7/10 difficulty, moderate-to-high regression risk on OWASP/Juliet/SecuriBench 100/100/97.7% TPR benchmarks). **Deferred to cognium-ai triage** with explicit posted analysis — if LLM-discovery already covers this CVE, close as won't-fix; if not, prioritize with explicit benchmark-gate plan. Cross-instance field-binding propagation shipped 3.39.0 per `TODO.md` — verify closes the Jenkins path end-to-end and close.
